%   INPUTS
%       robotPose   	3-by-1 pose vector in global coordinates (x,y,theta)
%       map         	N-by-4 matrix containing the coordinates of walls in
%                   	the environment: [x1, y1, x2, y2]
%       sensorOrigin	origin of the sensor-fixed frame in the robot frame: [x y]
%       angles      	K-by-1 vector of the angular orientation of the range
%                   	sensor(s) in the sensor-fixed frame, where 0 points
%                   	forward. All sensors are located at the origin of
%                   	the sensor-fixed frame.
%
%   OUTPUTS
%       depth       	K-by-1 vector of depths (meters)
